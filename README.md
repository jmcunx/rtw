## rtw - Remove Trailing Spaces

**Note:** Starting October 12 2023, Microsoft GitHub is forcing
me to use my 2FA access to my repositories via my Cell Phone
or some proprietary application.  So updates to this project
will no longer occur on GitHub.  Updates can be downloaded
from my gemini capsule:

* gemini://gem.sdf.org/jmccue/computer/repository.gmi
* gemini://gem.sdf.org/jmccue/computer/repository.gmi (mirror)

[See gemini wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)#Software) for clients.

This is a little utility created a very long time
ago for systems without sed(1).  All it does is Remove
Trailing White space from a file.

[j\_lib2](https://github.com/jmcunx/j_lib2) is an **optional** dependency.

[GNU automake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automake)
only confuses me, but this seems to be good enough for me.

**To compile:**
* If "DESTDIR" is not set, will install under /usr/local
* Execute ./build.sh to create a Makefile
* Works on Linux, BSD and AIX

_To uninstall_, execute
"make uninstall"
from the source directory
